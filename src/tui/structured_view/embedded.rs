//! Embedded (preview-pane) variant of the structured view.
//!
//! The full-screen loop in the parent module owns the terminal and the
//! event stream for the duration of the view. The embedded variant
//! instead lives inside the home screen's `App` loop, rendering into
//! the preview pane while the session list stays visible, mirroring
//! how live-send drives a terminal agent without leaving the home view.
//!
//! Split of responsibilities with the `App` loop:
//! - [`EmbeddedView::next_event`] is the cancel-safe await the App's
//!   `tokio::select!` races against its other arms. It only ever awaits
//!   channel receives, so dropping the future mid-poll loses nothing.
//! - [`EmbeddedView::apply_event`] runs in the winning arm's body
//!   (never cancelled) and may perform HTTP work: replay rehydration,
//!   queue drains, the bounded-backoff reconnect.
//! - Terminal input routes through [`EmbeddedView::handle_event`],
//!   which shares the parent module's intent dispatcher, so keybindings
//!   cannot drift from the full-screen view.
