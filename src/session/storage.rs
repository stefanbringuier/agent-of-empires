//! Session storage - JSON file persistence with in-process and cross-process
//! locking.
//!
//! `Storage` serialises read-modify-write cycles via two layers:
//!
//! 1. **In-process per-profile mutex** (one `Arc<Mutex<()>>` per profile name,
//!    registered process-wide). Performance + observability layer, not a
//!    correctness primitive on the supported platforms (Linux, macOS): a
//!    userspace mutex is roughly an order of magnitude cheaper than the
//!    flock syscall on the uncontended path, and same-thread re-entry
//!    deadlocks here immediately rather than via a 50ms polling loop on
//!    the flock. Removing this layer would still produce correct on-disk
//!    state because `fs2::FileExt` maps to `flock(2)`, whose locks are
//!    scoped to the open file description (OFD) on **both** Linux and
//!    macOS/BSD. (A common misconception is that macOS `flock` is
//!    process-scoped; it is not. Apple's flock(2) man page and
//!    `xnu/bsd/kern/kern_descrip.c::sys_flock` key the lock on
//!    `fp->fp_glob`, the open file description, identical in effect to
//!    Linux's documented OFD scoping.) Every `Storage::update` opens its
//!    own fd via `OpenOptions::open`, so two `Storage` handles in the
//!    same process get distinct OFDs and `flock` between them conflicts
//!    just as it does between processes. If AoE is ever ported to a
//!    platform whose underlying lock primitive is process-scoped (e.g.
//!    POSIX `fcntl(F_SETLK)` advisory locks, or certain Windows backends
//!    that key on the `HANDLE` rather than the open file description),
//!    this mutex becomes load-bearing and must not be removed without
//!    re-establishing intra-process exclusion.
//! 2. **Cross-process advisory `flock(2)`** on a sidecar lock file
//!    (`<profile_dir>/.storage.lock` for sessions+groups,
//!    `<app_dir>/.workspace-ordering.lock` for ordering). Sole guarantor
//!    of write serialisation; `atomic_write` separately guarantees that
//!    lock-free readers observe a consistent JSON document. Every mutator
//!    holds the flock from before `load` until after `atomic_write`.
//!    Polled `fs2::FileExt::try_lock_exclusive` with a 50ms backoff so
//!    that a wait longer than 1s fires a single `tracing::warn`; the
//!    kernel releases the lock on process exit, including SIGKILL, so a
//!    crashed peer cannot wedge other aoe processes. Mirrors the pattern
//!    already used by `recovery.rs` and `logging.rs`.
//!
//! Title writers additionally hold an app-global, per-session title flock
//! across persistence and the post-commit tmux rekey. It is independent of
//! profile so a cross-profile move and writers using either profile still
//! serialize. Terminal title writers and launch callers then acquire the
//! source profile's per-instance lifecycle flock before any profile Storage
//! mutex/flock: session title -> lifecycle -> Storage.
//!
//! All mutation goes through `update` (load -> mutate -> save under both
//! locks). `save_workspace_ordering` is private and only consumed by
//! `update_workspace_ordering` internally; the per-profile `save` /
//! `save_groups` helpers were removed entirely. This keeps it structurally
//! impossible to bypass the locks.
//!
//! Lock-ordering rule across the process: a mutation that can change or create
//! a `(title, project_path)` pair first acquires the app-global session identity
//! flock. A title-changing mutation of an existing session then acquires that
//! session's app-dir title flock, followed by the source profile's lifecycle
//! flock, before any profile `Storage` lock. A path-only manual edit skips the
//! title flock but still nests lifecycle and Storage beneath identity. The
//! identity lock is retained through the durable commit and cache publication,
//! then released before post-commit tmux rekey; the session-title and lifecycle
//! locks remain held through rekey. `aoe add` has no existing session id, so it
//! takes identity directly before Storage. Launch and same-profile restart do
//! not take identity: their order is session title, lifecycle, then Storage.
//! A `restart_selected_session` profile move is the exception: it acquires
//! identity before the session-title and lifecycle locks even when the
//! `(title, project_path)` pair is unchanged. Code must never acquire identity
//! or session title while holding lifecycle or Storage.
//!
//! Server callers MUST drop `AppState.instances` (tokio RwLock) before
//! acquiring any flock via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. A flock can park on
//! a wedged peer for arbitrary time; holding the tokio RwLock across the wait
//! would block every other reader/writer and park the worker thread. The
//! cross-process storage flock is acquired AFTER the in-process mutex and
//! released BEFORE it (RAII drop order). The closure passed to `update` is
//! `FnOnce(...) -> Result<R>` and cannot await, so `std::sync::Mutex` is safe
//! across the body even on the tokio runtime. A caller already holding the
//! outer session-title and lifecycle locks must use the internal locked launch
//! path rather than reacquiring them.
//!
//! `Storage::update` closures must remain CPU/memory only (no network, user
//! input, or tmux work). The profile-move transaction has one explicit
//! exception: its `before_commit` effect may perform an already-preflighted
//! worktree move or sandbox-container release, never a tmux rekey. Across that
//! effect BOTH per-profile mutexes and BOTH cross-process storage flocks are
//! held (they are acquired in canonical directory order before `load` and
//! released only after the final write), so every peer process is excluded from
//! both profiles. Every subprocess is bounded: Git mutations use the worktree
//! mutation timeout and container commands use the runtime timeout. The effect
//! must not re-enter storage.
//!
//! Residual window: `before_commit` can move the worktree before profile rows
//! are written. A later write or sync failure may retain source and target rows
//! with the same global session id, or retain only the source row pointing at
//! the old leaf. The TUI excludes ambiguous ids instead of selecting a profile
//! by iteration order. Effect-first ordering still makes a failed worktree move
//! a clean abort that changes no profile row.
//!
//! `update_workspace_ordering` and `Storage::update` must NOT be called from
//! inside each other's closures. They use distinct lock files but acquiring
//! both in different orders across processes would deadlock cross-process.
//! Today no caller does this; this comment is the invariant.
